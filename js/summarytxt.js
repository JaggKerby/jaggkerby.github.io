No&nbsp;one rejects, dislikes, or&nbsp;avoids pleasure itself, because it&nbsp;is&nbsp;pleasure, but because those who do&nbsp;not know how to&nbsp;pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.

The languages only differ in&nbsp;their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a&nbsp;new common language would be&nbsp;desirable: one could refuse to&nbsp;pay expensive translators. To&nbsp;achieve this, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;necessary to&nbsp;have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If&nbsp;several languages coalesce, the grammar of&nbsp;the resulting language is&nbsp;more simple and regular than that of&nbsp;the individual languages. The new common language will be&nbsp;more'
